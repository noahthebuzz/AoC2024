## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into 24 folders, one for each day of December leading up to Christmas Eve:

### Folders
- **`day01`** to **`day24`**: Each folder contains:
  - `task.txt`: The original task description for the day.
  - `input.txt`: The input data for the challenge.
  - `solution.py`: My Python implementation solving the challenge.

### Files
- **`main.py`**: The core script that initializes the repository structure, ensuring every day's folder and files are neatly set up for the coding journey.
